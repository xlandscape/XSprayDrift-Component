<h2>Dividing a plane into bands</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>bands</code> function is a topological function that subdivides a
Euclidean plane into parallel bands of equal width. It returns, for a given
set of points, the membership of each point to an individual band.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
bands(x, y, angle, width = 1, angle.def = c("mathematical", "meteorological"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vectors of point coordinates. Must have the same length.
NAs are not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>angle</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric scalar in degrees specifying the orientation of bands.
NA is not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric scalar specifying the width of bands in the coordinate
system of the point coordinates. Must be positive. NA is not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>angle.def</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the definition of angles used.
<code>"mathematical"</code> angles increase counter-clockwise from the direction
of the x-axis, <code>"meteorological"</code> angles increase clockwise from the
counter-direction of the y-axis.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>bands</code> function works on a set of points on a two-dimensional
Euclidean plane. Points are given by their <code>x</code>- and
<code>y</code>-coordinates. The plane is subdivided into parallel bands of given
<code>width</code> and <code>angle</code>. The angle can either be specified
mathematically, i.e., 0 degrees is facing along the x-axis and increasing
counter-clockwise, or meteorologically, i.e., 0 degree is facing in opposite
direction from the y-axis (wind from the North blowing towards the South) and
increasing clockwise. Arbitrary angles can be passed to the function, but
they will be internally transformed to mathematical angles in the interval [0
degree; 180 degrees). The intersection of straight lines going through the
points with the x- or y-axis is then calculated. Whether the intersection
with the x- or y-axis is calculated, is decided on the angle and aims at
limiting the inscribed angle to the selected axis to a maximum of 45 degrees.
This step prevents precision issues that occur when using trigonometric
functions with steeper angles. The intersection is rounded to the specified
<code>width</code> and numbered consecutively. The resulting values determine the
band, on which each point is located. Equal values thereby identify the same
band and different values identify different bands.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a numeric vector of the length of <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>. Equal values indicate that points are located on the same band
and differing outputs that they are located on different bands. This makes
the function useful for topological grouping of points.

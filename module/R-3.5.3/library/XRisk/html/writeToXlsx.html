<h2>Write xlsx file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>writeToXlsx</code> writes data into xlsx workbooks.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
writeToXlsx(data, file, author = "")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list. Contains the data to write to the xlsx workbook.</p>
</td></tr>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>openxlsx</code> package must be installed for this function to work. The
function writes different kind of data into a xlsx workbook. Every item of
<code>x</code> is added as an own worksheet to the workbook where the names of
<code>x</code> will be used as the names of the worksheets. If the data to be
added to a worksheet is a character vector, each element of the vector will
be written as an own paragraph into a cell in the first column. Paragraphs
are separated by blank rows. Text is wrapped to 80 characters and each line
will be written to a different row. Data given as a data.frame is passed
as a whole to the <code><a href="../../openxlsx/html/writeDataTable.html">writeDataTable</a></code> function. Other
types of data are written elementwise into the worksheet. The <code>author</code>
is added as a metadatum to the workbook.

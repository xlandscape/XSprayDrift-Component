<h2>Calculate the minimum downwind distance between sources and sinks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mindwdist</code> calculates the minimum downwind distance between two types
of points: sources and sinks.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
mindwdist(
  x,
  y,
  direction,
  source.indices = 1L,
  max.deviation = 5,
  direction.def = c("meteorological", "mathematical")
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vectors of receptor coordinates. Must have the same
length. NAs are not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric scalar specifying the direction of wind in
degrees. Must be in the range [0 degree; 360 degree). NA is not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>source.indices</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector specifying the indices of the
sources. All values must be in the range [1; length(x)]. NAs are not
allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>max.deviation</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric scalar specifying the maximum deviation from
the <code>direction</code> when identifying downwind sinks. Must be in the range
[0 degree; 360 degree). NA is not allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>direction.def</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the definition of angles.
<code>"mathematical"</code> angles are increased counter-clockwise from the
direction of the x-axis, <code>"meteorological"</code> angles are increased
clockwise from the counter-direction of the y-axis.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>mindwdist</code> function works with a set of 2D-points given by their
point coordinates, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Each point is either a source or a
possible sink where the <code>source.indices</code> vector specifies the indices of
the coordinates that describe sources. Internally, source and sink receptors
are represented in matrices, each showing the relation between an individual
pair of source and sink. Two relational properties are considered this way:
the Euclidean distance between the two points and the angle between the
x-axis and the straight line passing through both. The angle is used to
identify the points that are located downwind with the wind direction given
by the <code>direction</code> argument. Only sinks that deviate not more than the
<code>max.deviation</code> in degrees from the <code>direction</code> are considered
downwind. The direction can be supplied according to a meteorological
definition, i.e., the direction in which the wind blows (0 degrees is South
and angles increase clockwise), or in a mathematical way, i.e., 0 degrees is
along the x-axis and angles increase counter-clockwise. For each sink, the
smallest distance to any source upwind is reported. It is therefore a
combination of distance and angle that defines pairs of
source-sink-relationships with minimum distance, ignoring sinks that have no
source upwind as well as sources that are not nearest to any sink receptor.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of the length of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that shows the
Euclidean distance of each point to the nearest source in units of the
point coordinate system. Source receptors will have a minimum distance of
0. Sinks not located downwind of a source are reported with <code>NA</code>.
